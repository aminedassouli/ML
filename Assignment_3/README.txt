# Unsupervised Learning and Dimensionality Reduction
The assignment is about approaching unsupervised learning models and dimensionality reduction techniques.

There are five major parts:
- Unsupervised Learning models: K-means and Expectation Maximization
- Reduction techniques: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Randomized Projection, and Random Forest
- Using clustering on dimension reduced datasets
- Fit and test an artificial neural network on the dimension reduced datasets
- Fit and test an artificial neural network on the clustering labels as features


## Required packages
- numpy
- pandas
- scipy
- sklearn
- matplotlib


## Running the code
Here is the link to Github where there is all the code used for the assignment: https://github.com/aminedassouli/ML/tree/master/Assignment_3

- The jupyter notebook containing all the analysis is named "Unsupervised_learning.ipynb". The datasets "Bank Customer Churn Modeling" and "Car Evaluation" are used.
The path to the csv files containing the two datasets must be specified in the Configuration part of the notebook. 

There should not be any problem to run the code in the notebooks if following the jupyter cell by cell.
The entire analysis is done on the PDF file.


# Datasets
The two datasets can be found in the github repository as well (https://github.com/aminedassouli/ML/tree/master/Assignment_3/Data). 

They can also be downloaded directly from kaggle:
