# Supervised-Learning
Working on two classification problems using  five supervised machine learning algorithms.

## Required packages
- numpy
- pandas
- scipy
- sklearn
- matplotlib
- keras

## Running the code
Here is the link to Github with two jupyter notebooks (one for each classification problem/dataset): https://github.com/aminedassouli/ML/Assignment_1

There should not any problem to run the code if following the jupyter cell by cell.
The analysis is done on PDF file.


# Datasets :
The two datasets can be found in the github repository as well (https://github.com/aminedassouli/ML/Assignment_1/Data). 

They can also be downloaded directly from kaggle:
