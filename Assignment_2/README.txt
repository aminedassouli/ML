# Random Optimization
The assignment is about approaching randomized optimization techniques.

There are two major parts:
- The first part is about optimizing the weights of a Neural Network
- The second part is about testing and comparing the optimization algorithms on three differents problems


## Required packages
- numpy
- pandas
- scipy
- sklearn
- matplotlib
- keras
- six
- mlrose
- mlrose_hiive


## Running the code
Here is the link to Github where there is all the code used for the assignment: https://github.com/aminedassouli/ML/tree/master/Assignment_2

- The jupyter notebook containing the analysis of the first part is named "NeuralNetworkOptimization.ipynb". It uses the python files 
"neural_network_custom.py" and "opt_algorithms_custom.py" which contain the new implemented classes and functions of 'mlrose' library.
It also uses the dataset Car evaluation. The path to the txt file containing the data must be specified in the Configuration part of the notebook. 

- The jupyter notebook containing the analysis of the second part is named "ThreeOptimizationProblems.ipynb".

There should not be any problem to run the code in the notebooks if following the jupyter cell by cell.
The entire analysis is done on the PDF file.


# Dataset :
The dataset used in the first part of the assignment is the Car Evaluation dataset, it can be downloaded directly from Kaggle at the following url:
