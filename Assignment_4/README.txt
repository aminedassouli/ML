# Markov Decision Processes
The assignment is about approaching exploring Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and reinforcement learning techniques.

We worked on two different MDPs from openai:
- Frozen Lake: https://gym.openai.com/envs/FrozenLake-v0/
- Mountain Car: https://gym.openai.com/envs/MountainCar-v0/

We used three different algorithms in our analysis:
- Value Iteration
- Policy Iteration
- Q-learning


## Required packages
- numpy
- gym
- scipy
- sklearn
- matplotlib


## Running the code
Here is the link to Github where there is all the code used for the assignment: https://github.com/aminedassouli/ML/tree/master/Assignment_4

The jupyter notebook containing all the analysis is named "MDP.ipynb". 

There should not be any problem to run the code in the notebook if following the jupyter cell by cell.

The entire analysis is done on the PDF file.
